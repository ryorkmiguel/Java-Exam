Instructions: For Java, servlet and spring questions, create a new project, finish your code, test, clean and zip up the entire project folder and submit. For HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, create a new folder under localhost htdocs, finish coding and testing, zip up the folder and submit.
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. 
The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):

Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain" line and writes down the corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.

Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
Deciphering is done in reverse, with a right shift of 3.

Your mission: Create a generic Caesar encoding/decoding function which takes a string and the number of places to shift as a positive or negative number (positive is to the right and negative is to the left) and returns the encoded string. Since decoding is the same as encoding with the opposite shift, one function should be enough to both encode and decode. It should handle both upper case and lower case characters. Use Core Java only.
Descriptive statistics on any set of numbers include measures of central tendency, i.e., mean (average), median (middle of the distribution) and mode (most commonly occurring number); measures of dispersion, i.e., variance, standard deviation, range, inter-quartile range; skewness (i.e. symmetry or lack of) and kurtosis (i.e. heavy or light tail). I have attached a file with 1000 samples of 5 unique random numbers between 1 and 20. 
Your mission: Write a Java program that reads each line (format: Set <n>: <i>, <j>, <k>, <l>, <m>; e.g., Set 74: 2, 3, 5, 7, 14), calculates mean, median and standard deviation for each line and writes input and output to a different file.
Bootstrap allows creation of scrollable panels. We used bootstrap in class to implement srolling panels. 
Your mission: Use bootstrap framework to create a webpage with details about roses (you can get content from Wikipedia and images from the web) that offers visitors two layout choices: side-by-side scrolling content or stacked scrolling content. Switch layout according to visitor choice (toggle button). Use bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Federal Holidays are fixed as: 

Your mission: Write a simple front-end form that accepts a name and date-of-birth to pass to a Java servlet which a) calculates age, and b) figures out which is the nearest Federal Holiday this year (by calculating date difference and keeping track of the minimum) and redirects to a web page that displays age and nearest federal holiday.
Convert Question 4 to Spring.
